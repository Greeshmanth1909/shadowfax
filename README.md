# Shadowfax
Shadowfax is the culmination of my love towards Chess, Golang and The Lord of The Rings trilogy (hence the name). The project is entirely written from scratch in Golang and will be using classic evlauation and move generation methods. I also plan on upgrading it to an NNUE in version 2. If that sounds interesting, consider giving this repo a star. Thanks!

# Note
The project is still in the early stages of development and not completely functional.
